OpenGL-Glew / App-Shadertoy version 0.01
========================

This Perl distribution contains an offline runner for shader toys
from https://www.shadertoy.com . It also currently includes the
OpenGL::Glew library, at least until that is merged into the

The program requires an OpenGL 4 compatible graphics card. Users of
Intel integrated graphics will likely not be able to enjoy this.
